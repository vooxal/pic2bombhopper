## Running

You'll need [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) to compile this program.

* Download the code as a zip (Green button up there)
* Extract all from the zip, and enter the code folder. (the folder should contain folder src, images, and js)
* Right click the empty space and click "Open terminal"
* In the terminal type `cargo run --bin gui` this will take a couple minutes, but after that a window should open up.
